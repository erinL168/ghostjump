Ghost Jump is a survival assembly game where you, the ghost of Bartholemew VI of Castlevanlimgrave, must re-live this hell of evading the ever-excruciatingly hot lava from burning your ghostly entity. You, Bartholemew VI, had done horrible deeds during your life and now live cursed with the life of a wandering ghost. Your inability to think critically and your lack of cognitive ability (due to 30 generations of inbreeding which technically is not your fault) had caused you to roam into the forbidden land: the Internet. Tales of monsters, the size of ten men with razor-black teeth and glistening poison seeping through their pores lurking at the entrance would make even the bravest knight shudder. Others would say there was no such thing, rather than a monster, it was the umbra of a human being that would creep out and entice villagers to enter. Some even reported that surviving individuals who were caught yet miraculously found their way back would change personalities. They would become sucked into a world of fantasy and end up trapped forever in the very room they slept in, speaking gibberish yet never coming out nor letting anyone in. Eventually, they would die of starvation.
Throughout the country, these strange and horrid stories spread and children as young as five were told such tales; how the bad children would get taken away and return with the very same symptoms. 

To the people of Castlevanlimgrave, the Internet was just beyond the hills of Stormhill; its entrance was shrouded by venomous thorns and emerald-green vines. On a stroll, you, Bartholemew VI, had believed you had seen the shadow of your mother. You screamed and shouted till you felt needles puncturing your throat. Your arms burned as if set on fire, yet you trudged through the thorns and vines slithering at your feet, but you found yourself abruptly stopping. What you followed was not a shadow at all, but a goddess that shined like the sun but eyes the colour of thunder and ice. 

"What do you desire, mortal?" A voice echoed. You look around to see who could have uttered the sound.

"Who's there?" You ask in rage, "Where is my mother?"

The goddess' eyes narrowed, "Who else but the magnificent being before you? Kneel mortal." Her voice bellowed.

[...]


In short, you, Bartholemew VI called the goddess a fat retard and demanded your mother because you needed her to change your diaper. Thus, the goddess assigned your punishment to a random Reddit user and thus ended up in this situation.
